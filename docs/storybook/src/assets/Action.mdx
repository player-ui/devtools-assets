# Action Asset

The `action` asset is used when you want a user to perform some _action_. It typically manifests as a `button` or `link` depending on the context, and intention.

Actions can advance Player's state machine using the `value` prop, and/or evaluate an expression using the `exp` prop.

## Basic Use Case

The example below uses the `exp` property to evaluate an expression when the action is clicked.
This will increment the count, and update the label

<Canvas of={ActionStories.Basic} />

## Navigation Transition

<Canvas of={ActionStories.Transitions} />
