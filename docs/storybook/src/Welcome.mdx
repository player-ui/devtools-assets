# Devtools-UI

Welcome to Devtools-UI, a monorepo containing a collection of assets packages and an assets plugin designed to be leveraged by [Player-UI](https://player-ui.github.io/).

## Packages

The packages in this repository are designed to be used as assets in Player-UI. Each package is self-contained and can be used independently.

## Assets Plugin

The assets plugin is a convenient way to use the assets packages in Player-UI. It provides a unified interface for managing and using the assets.

It register the following assets to your React Player instance:

- action
- collection
- input
- list
- navigation
- object-inspector
- text

The easiest way to get started is to use the `@devtools-ui/plugin` package.

## Installation

To install `@devtools-ui/plugin`, you can use pnpm or yarn:

```sh
pnpm i @devtools-ui/plugin
```

or

```sh
yarn add @devtools-ui/plugin
```

## Usage

```ts
import { ReactPlayer } from "@player-ui/react";
import DevtoolsUIPlugin from "@devtools-ui/plugin";

const reactPlayer = new ReactPlayer({
  plugins: [new DevtoolsUIPlugin()],
});
```

And leverage the DSL components to author your content:

```tsx
import { Collection, Text } from "@devtools-ui/plugin";

const content = (
  <Collection>
    <Collection.Values>
        <Text>My Collection</Text>
    </List>
  </Collection>
);
```
